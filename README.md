# PDF Scraper

Hey, First off... if you came to check out what I've been working on most recently, thank you! I know there isn't much here right now. That's because I'm really wanting to play around with a ton of tech. I know it is fustrating to click on someone's repo, hoping you might get a real quick projection of what that person is doing. Hopefully it's amazing. Knock your socks off! Instead, you get a near empty Readme.md and a ton of directories and files to look at. Right now, that is exaclty what I can offer at the moment. At least, for this particular repo. This little repo is designed for me to help bring in (scrape) pdf data, process it, and import it into a database that I've yet to build. Afterwards, I want to use the acumilated database as resource for a DnD Beyound clone/killer. Yet, that is a much farther asperation goal.

# Plan

- [x] Build PDF text scraper
- [ ] Build PDF image scraper
- [ ] Build PDF table scraper
- [ ] Run text scraper over all purchased books
- [ ] Clean books' text
- [ ] Design marker library for DnD 5e TTRPG System structure system
- [ ] Create parser script to read markers
- [ ] Use marker library and parser script to import into a database schema
- [ ] Build web application to read, modify, and create new data-entries

... A ton more. However, I expect I'll will change or create a new repo specifically for the TTRPG-SMASH [Table Top Role Playing Game System Manager And Structure Helper]
