## (2) Living Creature Structure

This can be confusing. VERY confusing when you play DnD. As such, I want to set a structure for the how I will categorize the living "beings."

### (3) Living

Physically animated beings that eat, sleep, grow, and struggle to stay alive.

#### (4) Non-intelligent Animal

This a movile living creature or animal that eats, sleeps, and struggles to grow, reproduce, and survives. It is not aware of morals or thoroughly understands consequences. Examples: animals such as cows, dogs, and cats

#### (4) Non-intellegent Plant

This a non-movile living creature that eats, sleeps, and struggles to grow, reproduce, and survive. Examples: grass, flowers, and roses

##### (5) Intelligent Animal

This can refer to a thinking species or animal that is aware of its surroundings, builds a culture or community, and has a set or morality. Examples: human, goblin and gnome

###### (6) Race

A sub class to an animal creature. For example: You can gnome sub-set called "Deep-Gnome" for other gnome race families.

####### (7) Lineage

A sub class to a Race. For example: You can have a NPC of the GerThumper clan of Deep-Gnome, who belongs to the gnome race.
