The race you choose contributes to
your character’s identity in an important way,
by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells.
These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for
example, can be unusual but memorable characters. Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3.
Note these increases and remember to apply them later. Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet.
Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.
