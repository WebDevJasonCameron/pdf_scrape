# PDF Scraper Log

# 2023 03 14 | Working Out

Suprising, the strip text from pdf is working really well. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done on the final text product, but I've added more tools that quicken the process. I am thinking about creating a CLI tool that combines all these tools into one managable aplication. Some of those tools include the strip tool (text, table and pix), combine lines, and remove lines starting (and in the future, ending or conatining) a specified string. I also like the idea of being able to set one variable (say the targeted output path) and leaving that variable for all the chapters of a book that get stripped. Yes, I can recursively collect all the chapter and put them in one text file. However, that ended up being very difficult to edit. I might have the CLI tool still recursively grab each PDF chapter's text and place them in their own chapter text file. This is really a WIP.

Web scraper wasn't going do what I wanted (at least not right now). So, I've moved to creating pdf documents and want to scrape those to get everything into a future db for ttrpgs
